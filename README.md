# Reusable Components

This is a project created with a purpose of build reusable design components using React, it was part of a challenge given by the FrontEnd Development Track of Devchallenges.io. 

First step was to create a reusable button component, following the user stories below:

- User story: I can see different button types: default, outline and text
- User story: I can choose to disable box-shadow
- User story: I can choose to disable the button
- User story: I can choose to have an icon on the left or right (Use Google - Icon and at least 5 variants)
- User story: I can have different button sizes
- User story: I can have different colors
- User story: I can still access all button attribute

There was also a Figma prototype sketch which I followed for design guidelines. The NavBar of it was not mandatory, but I design it any way, it will make the user goes to the Input page as soon as I finish the second part of the challenge, which is to create a Input reusable component.
